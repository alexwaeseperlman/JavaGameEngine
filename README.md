## What is this?
I wrote this when I was 13, after a YouTuber I liked mentioned he had written a game engine from scratch using Java and OpenGL. I thought that sounded fun so I decided to make my own. 

It supports the following features
- VAOs and VBOs
- Shaders with uniform values and custom attributes
- Loading textures from files
- Getting inputs from keyboard and mouse
- Rendering to frame buffers
- Rendering from a cameras perspective

I never actually wrote a game in this but that wasn't the point for me. I did it to learn about graphics and Java.
